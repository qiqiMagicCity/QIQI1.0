/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GreenTrader Analytics.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and transactions,
 * with an additional role-based access control (RBAC) layer for administrators. Users can
 * only access their own profile data and associated transactions, while administrators have
 * read-only access to all user data and transactions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The `userId` must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction history for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles and transactions are private to the user, except for administrators with read-only access.
 * - Administrators are granted read access to all user data via role-based access control.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, with key exceptions for ownership fields.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userProfileId` is used in the path for both `/users/{userProfileId}` and
 *   `/users/{userProfileId}/transactions/{transactionId}`. This ensures that the
 *   `isOwner(userId)` function can be used efficiently without additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - No segregation is needed as all data is private and access is controlled via ownership and roles.
