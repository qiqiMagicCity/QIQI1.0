    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the GreenTrader Analytics application, emphasizing secure and efficient data access for user-specific information. The structure leverages path-based ownership for user profiles and transactions, ensuring that data is segregated by user and access rules can be applied consistently.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** The transactions collection is structured under the `/users/{userProfileId}` path. This structure inherently achieves authorization independence as access control can be directly applied based on the `userProfileId` without needing to `get()` data from other collections. The `userProfileId` is present in every document of the subcollections.\n*   **QAPs (Queries are not Filters):** The path-based ownership ensures secure `list` operations. Security rules can allow listing documents only if `request.auth.uid == userId`.\n*   **Structural Segregation:** Each collection contains only documents of the same type and access requirements, simplifying security rule definitions.\n*   **Data Clarity:** Field names are explicit (e.g., `userProfileId` for ownership), and timestamps are in standard formats."
