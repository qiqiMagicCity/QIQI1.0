TSLA260116C00400000 @ 2026-02-10: MISSING

--- 3. Logic Path Audit (Code Trace) ---
Priority confirmed in src/contexts/holdings-provider.tsx:
1. manualMarkPrices[sym]
2. priceRecord?.price (Real-time)
3. todayEodMap[sym].close (Today EOD)
4. refEodMap[sym].close (Previous EOD - IF ASSET IS OPTION)

Risk Identified: The fallback only applies to 'Option' UI display (line 991),
but computeDayPnLSymbol (line 199) lacks the 'refEodMap' fallback for TodayPl calculation.
Result: UI may show a price, but Today Pl remains '--'.

--- 4. Dead Rule Alignment ---
Dead Rule A (Fallback): Currently PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (UI only). Result: YES (Partial)
Dead Rule B (Stock/Option Parity): NO (Logic has explicit assetType === 'option' branch).
Dead Rule C (Calendar Reliability): YES (prevNyTradingDayString uses recursive search with holidays).

--- 5. Acceptance Data (Snapshot) ---
Current hour is ~08:55 AM NY (Pre-market). Today's EOD is guaranteed MISSING for most symbols.
If we were to run at this moment, most options would rely on refEodMap (Yesterday).
