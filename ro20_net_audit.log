=== [EVID] RO-20: 'NET' Minimal Dependency Audit ===

--- B. NET Transaction Timeline (NY Days) ---
Code Analysis:
1. Today Pl (Row): Requires 2026-02-10 (Ref Day) and 2026-02-11 (Live/Today).
2. YTD PnL (Global): Requires DAILY EOD for NET from 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-11 if NET was held.
3. BUG: fetchEod() [HoldingsProvider:655-661] requests ytdBase (2025-12-31) for ALL uniqueSymbols.

--- C. Actual vs Minimal Dependency (Prediction) ---
Symbol: NET
Minimal Set for Row Display: [2026-02-10, 2026-02-11]
Actual Requested Set (per fetchEod): [2025-12-31, 2026-01-30, 2026-02-06, 2026-02-10, 2026-02-11]
