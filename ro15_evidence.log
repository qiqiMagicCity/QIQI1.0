=== [EVID] RO-15: AutoHeal Closed-Loop Audit ===
--- B. Backend Success (Sample: 2026-02-10_NVDA) ---
OfficialClose found: YES | Status: ok | Close: 188.54 | Provider: fmp
Raw retrievedAt: {}

--- C. Completion Signal Presence ---
NVDA eodRevision: 1

--- D. Signal Path Analysis ---
1. Backend Completion: Worker writes doc to officialCloses.
2. Signal Defect: Backend DOES NOT update any reactive field (eodRevision/lastBackfillAt).
3. Frontend Defect: HoldingsProvider only updates lastBackfillTs on direct success, NOT background success.
   - Line 843 in holdings-provider.tsx: if (isQueued) { // No lastBackfillTs update here }
