=== [EVID] RO-14: AutoHeal Linkage Audit ===
E2. Correlation ID Schema: ${date}_${symbol} -> 2026-02-10_RO14TEST

--- E4: Firestore Result Probe ---
Initial Status: MISSING

--- E5: Revision Linkage Audit ---
Current Revision for RO14TEST: N/A
Finding: Backend 'fetchAndSaveOfficialClose' LACKS the eodRevision increment logic.

--- E6: Front-end State Evidence ---
1. Spinner Visibility: Controlled by 'isAutoHealing' (boolean).
2. Progress Text: Controlled by 'autoHealProgress.status' (string).
3. Linkage Break: In 'HoldingsProvider', background (queued) tasks do NOT update 'lastBackfillTs'.
   Result: The UI waits, tasks finish in background, but the UI NEVER refreshes because no state change triggers a new 'fetchEod()'.
